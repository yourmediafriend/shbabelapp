This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## shBabel React App

This is a demo app which can be viewed at [shBabel App](https://shbabel.com). 

It is an expermental site where I try out UI idea, file and component structures, and try to solve networking and authorization issues. It has allowed me to learn the fundamentals of React and push it to practical levels. 

The code is not clean and the site has not been optimised. It take 15+ seconds to load so you have been warned.

It is currently linked to a Drupal cms.
